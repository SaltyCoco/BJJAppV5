# BJJAppV5
iOS app that is currently under development

# Description
In my free time I work on an iOS, android and website for the Bjj gym I train at.  It is more of a hobby as I have no alusions of gradure to be the next Elon Zuckerberg with this.  I just really enjoy creating apps and this gives me the opportunity to do things the way I want to which helps to scratch the itch of dealing with client requests.

# Basic Structure
The app is tied to aws cognito for all auth.  I also use facebook and google for federated ids.  Cognito issues keys to the users which ties them to an IAM for the policies.  The app uses DynamoDB as a data source to log user's attendance, share videos, chat, view updates and more.  

# Build
To build this app I use cocopods and amplify-cli.  The pod and amplify files were not included as they take up a lot of space and are autogenerated via the terminal anyway.  Other things are created in aws as well such as in cloudformation and a few lambdas.
